**TTI (Time to Interactive)** = API call to first command execution. Lower is better.

<br>

## What We Measure

**Daily: Time to Interactive (TTI)**

```
API Request → Provisioning → Boot → Ready → First Command
└───────────────────── TTI ─────────────────────┘
```

Each benchmark creates a fresh sandbox, runs `node -v`, and records wall-clock time. 100 iterations per provider, every day, fully automated.

**Powered by ComputeSDK** — We use [ComputeSDK](https://github.com/computesdk/computesdk), a multi-provider SDK, to test all sandbox providers with the same code. One API, multiple providers, fair comparison. Interested in multi-provider failover, sandbox packing, and warm pooling? [Check out ComputeSDK](https://github.com/computesdk/computesdk).

**Sponsor-only tests coming soon:** Stress tests, warm starts, multi-region, and more. [See roadmap →](#roadmap)

## Methodology

Each benchmark creates a fresh sandbox, runs `node -v`, and records wall-clock time. We run three test modes daily:

**Sequential** — Sandboxes are created one at a time. Each is created, tested, and destroyed before the next begins. 100 iterations per provider. This is the baseline — isolated cold-start performance with no contention.

**Staggered** — 100 sandboxes are launched per provider with a 200ms delay between each, gradually ramping up concurrent load. Reveals how TTI degrades under increasing pressure, queue depth effects, and rate limiting behavior.

**Burst** — 100 sandboxes are created simultaneously with no delay between launches. Tests how providers handle sudden spikes — provisioning queue depth, rate limiting, and failure rates under peak demand.

For each provider we report min, max, median, P95, P99, and average TTI, plus a **composite score** (0–100) that combines weighted timing metrics with success rate. Providers must be both fast *and* reliable to score well.

### Composite Score

Before computing timing statistics, the bottom 5% and top 5% of successful iterations are trimmed to reduce outlier influence from transient network issues or cold-start anomalies. Each timing metric is then scored against a fixed 10-second ceiling: `score = 100 × (1 − value / 10,000ms)`. A 200ms median scores 98; anything ≥10s scores 0. These individual scores are combined with weighted emphasis on median (60%), P95 (25%), and P99 (15%), then multiplied by the provider's success rate (0–1). A provider with 90% success has its score reduced by 10% — reliability is non-negotiable.

All tests run on GitHub Actions at 00:00 UTC daily. Providers are tested using ComputeSDK — no gateway or proxy layer.
